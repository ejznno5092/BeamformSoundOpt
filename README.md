# Design and Optimization of Sound Acquisition Strategy: Application Based on Beamforming Technology

## Overview

In the evolving landscape of computational sciences, the integration of advanced signal processing techniques with intelligent systems is crucial for improving human-computer interaction and environmental awareness. This repository presents a novel design and optimization framework for acoustic sensor arrays, leveraging beamforming technologies to enhance directional sensitivity and noise suppression.

## Motivation

Traditional sound acquisition methods often suffer from challenges such as:
- Suboptimal spatial resolution
- Poor sensitivity to target sounds
- Inability to perform robustly in noisy or dynamic environments

These issues limit their effectiveness in complex auditory scenarios. Our work addresses these challenges by employing a comprehensive strategy involving:
- Advanced array geometries
- Signal processing algorithms
- Adaptive filtering techniques
